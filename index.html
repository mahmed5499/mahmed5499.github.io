    <h1>Attack on Titan</h1>
    <p>
       <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan">When <strong>man-eating Titans</strong> first appeared 100 years ago,
       humans found safety behind massive walls that stopped 
       the giants in their tracks. But the safety they have had
       for so long is threatened when a <strong>colossal Titan smashes through the barriers</strong>,
       causing a flood of the giants into what had been the humans' safe zone. 
       During the carnage that follows, soldier Eren Jaeger sees one of the creatures 
       devour his mother, which leads him to vow that he will kill every Titan.
       He enlists some friends who survived to help him, and that group is humanity's 
       <strong>last</strong> hope for avoiding extinction at the hands of the monsters.</a>
